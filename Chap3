Data storage in HDFS:
  The higher the number of the replication factor, the system
  will be highly fault tolerant and will occupy that many numbers of time
  the file is saved, and also increase the metadata in NameNode.
[What an ungly sentence!Consider rephrasing it like this:]
--The higher the number of the replication factor (number of times
  the file is saved), the more fault tolerant the system will be, 
  but will occupy that many times of disk space, and also increase the metadata in NameNode.
